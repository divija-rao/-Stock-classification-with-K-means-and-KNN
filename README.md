This project, as a part of Machine-Learning-in-Finance course, involves advanced financial analysis and machine learning techniques applied to companies in the Russell 2000 index.

**K-Means Clustering Analysis**: The project begins with clustering companies traded in the Russell 2000 index using K-Means analysis. This unsupervised machine learning technique groups similar companies together based on selected financial metrics, allowing for the identification of distinct clusters within the index

**Morningstar Stylebox Construction**: Following the clustering, a Morningstar Stylebox is built for the clustered companies. This involves categorizing the companies into a 3x3 grid based on market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth). This step provides a visual representation of the investment characteristics of the clustered companies

**KNN Classification**: The final technical aspect involves using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique to classify a new stock into the previously established clusters. This supervised learning algorithm assigns the new stock to a cluster based on its similarity to existing cluster members, allowing for quick categorization of new companies within the established framework
